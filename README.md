### This repo contains my implementations of:
- [ ] Homework (2/14)
- [ ] Lab (2/15)
- [ ] Disc (1/4)
- [ ] Project(0/1)
- [x] Lecture

### Prerequisite
1. Create a conda environment in name of your favor\
`conda create --name myenv`\
if you have any trouble shooting, click [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
2. Activate your new environment created with Conda\
`conda activate myenv`
3. Install otter-grader\
`pip install otter-grader`
4. Add a shell script so that your test files have parameters `OK_FORMAT = True`\
Find the shell script named 'add_ok.sh' in [lab](https://github.com/baichuanzhou/data100/tree/master/lab) and [hw](https://github.com/baichuanzhou/data100/tree/master/hw)\
Use command line to execute the shell script\
`bash add_ok.sh`

That should wrap things up and now you can proceed with assignments without any trouble.
