    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the process of signing up, renting and returning is automated. Through these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from one location and return them to another. We will be analyzing bike sharing data from Washington D.C. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will perform tasks to clean, visualize, and explore the bike sharing data. You will also investigate open-ended questions. These open-ended questions ask you to think critically about how the plots you have created provide insight into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reading plaintext delimited data into `pandas`\n",
    "* wrangling data for analysis\n",
    "* using EDA to learn about your data \n",
    "* making informative plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into autograded answers and free response. \n",
    "\n",
    "For autograded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots, your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will tolerate small variations such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible, as similarity is subject to the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that for ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect appropriate titles, axis labels, legends, etc. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question?** \n",

For the `agg` method, please check the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.aggregate.html#pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.aggregate) for examples on applying different aggregations per column. If you use the capability to do different aggregations by column, you can do this task with a single call to `groupby` and `agg`. For the `workingday` column we can take any of the values since we are grouping by the day, thus the value will be the same within each group. Take a look at the `'first'` or `'last'` aggregation functions.\n",

    "The density plots do not show us how the counts for registered and casual riders vary together. Use [`sns.lmplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html) to make a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between casual and registered counts. This time, let's use the `bike` DataFrame to plot hourly counts instead of daily counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `lmplot` function will also try to draw a linear regression line (just as you saw in Data 8). Color the points in the scatterplot according to whether or not the day is a working day (your colors do not have to match ours exactly, but they should be different based on whether the day is a working day). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many points in the scatter plot, so make them small to help reduce overplotting. Also make sure to set `fit_reg=True` to generate the linear regression line. You can set the `height` parameter if you want to adjust the size of the `lmplot`. \n",
